# filenote

docnotes is a Python utility used for automatically creating CSV files that explain the contents of a directory. The CSV file consists of: filename, date of label, and note.

When run, the program prompts the user for a note. If nothing is entered, then no note is entered. If a note exists, then the file is not prompted.
